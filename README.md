math game


Here, I have created a Math Game that will give me the opportunity to practice everything i have learned so far with  HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the web development course. 

This game is going to check how well you know your multiplication table.

1.Click the start button.
  once you clicked on the start button you will see a 60 secondes count down starting and you will get your first question

2.The question will be a multiplication of two numbers
  You will have a multiple choice answers to choose from.
  When choosing the right answer you will get a green message "Correct". The score will go up by one and get a new question
  
3.A wrong answer will give you a red message "Try Again!" as long as uou pick a wrong answer.
4. If the count down reach 0  you will get a message "GAME IS OVER YOUR SCORE IS:"
